# 👋 Hey, I'm Hexon!

## 🚀 About Me
I'm Hexon, a full-stack developer, creative problem solver, and tech enthusiast. I love building experimental tools, bots, and custom software projects for fun and for my companies. Whether it's Websites, a custom CLI tool, a VS Code extension, or a game mod — if it doesn't exist yet, I'm probably already working on it.

## 🛠️ What I Work On
- **BotForge Technologies** — AI-powered bots and automation tools.
- **NeuroVistaAI** — AI research, experiments, and prototypes.
- **NexCore Technologies** — Simple, fun, and educational software for kids.
- **Firenado** — Heavy metal band with original tracks in the works.
- **FatCoin** — An experimental cryptocurrency prototype.
- **HardEco** — Custom Minecraft hardcore economy mod.
- **EditorCollab 2.2** — Geometry Dash multiplayer editor mod for GD 2.2.
